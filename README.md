Hello GIThub

Im Matt looking to further my learning and study of code to change my career in welding/fabrication to developing. I have a strong IT background and have started to learn:

<ol>
  <li>HTML5</li>

 </ol>

Next to learn will be:

<ul>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>JAVA</li>
  <li>JQuery</li>
</ul>

Any input or ways for me to learn more about coding or the industry please let me know :).
